# D4.Implementation

## Introduction
Our website which is called Netshell is a video community that allows young people to watch and share videos, pushing videos based on personal choices and video quality.
This helps users to find the videos which contain right values and suit their tastes. It's a open community designed for young people, everyone can create an account.
Users can upload videos and download videos,they can make comments and share their own ideas about the video; For the low quality videos, they can report them and the 
administrator can remove them from sites.

## Implemented requirements
There're two implemented requirements 
* "As a user I want to login" (Ziang Zhou & Chufeng Zhou)

* "As a user I want to play videos online" (Shangyi Dai)

## Adopted technologies
* The major technology we used is HTML,PHP and JavaScript languages. 
* Our development environment depends on personal preference, several people use NetBeans, several use Notepad++.
* We use 'http-server' command and Xampp to create local server for develop test, rent a server for online test. 
* The reason for why we choose these technologies is: they are the best and most familiar tools for us to develop this website
## Learning/training
In order to put out this basic application, we had to read some articles to learn more how to use JavaScript although we have learned it. We also had to learn the git commands for posting things to the GitHub. We also watched videos that were posted in the discord on how to use and code in JavaScript.

## Deployment
We plan for continual deployment once we get our application farther along. We would have update once a month and consistently pushing out updates and patches for the best experience for our users.

## Readme File


## Look & Feel
The look and feel we are trying to go with is simple and easy-to-use. We want the web page to be easy to navigate and figure out. The communities are very clearly and can find what videos you want easily. The images under each section can attract people's attention. The user will go to pagination of the video If user click the image.

## Lessons learned
I have learned our team members need more communication and exchanges, and next we'll focus on coding and communicating.

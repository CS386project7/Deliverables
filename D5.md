# Design

## 1. Description
What we made is not a program, but a very complete video webpage. Currently, we only support browsing our webpage on computer. Webpage production is based on our own hobbies and interviews with friends around us to make the decision for video. Although we already have many websites and apps for watching videos, many websites do not support user upload, online viewing and download functions, so we want to create a website for users to upload and download videos. This website will be of great help to those who like to edit videos. This website is equivalent to a free resource library for users to download, and users can upload their own videos to the website to share with others. The webpage has also established 8 partitions so that users can quickly find the videos they need.

The website requires users to have an account and password in order for users to log in to the website. After the user logs in, there is a dedicated block in  the user interface for users to upload videos, and users can upload videos that they make or are willing to share with others. When coming to the main page of the video, the user will see 8 different sections, namely Animation, Music, Movie, Life, News, Dance, Digital, Games. Click on the different sections to go to the corresponding video section. After clicking the picture, you will come to a new interface, and the video will start playing. Below the video, there is a row of buttons for download, comment and Thumb up. Users can make different operations according to their own ideas.

# Design

## 1. Description
What we made is not a program, but a very complete video webpage. Currently, we only support browsing our webpage on computer. Webpage production is based on our own hobbies and interviews with friends around us to make the decision for video. Although we already have many websites and apps for watching videos, many websites do not support user upload, online viewing and download functions, so we want to create a website for users to upload and download videos. This website will be of great help to those who like to edit videos. This website is equivalent to a free resource library for users to download, and users can upload their own videos to the website to share with others. The webpage has also established 8 partitions so that users can quickly find the videos they need.

The website requires users to have an account and password in order for users to log in to the website. After the user logs in, there is a dedicated block in  the user interface for users to upload videos, and users can upload videos that they make or are willing to share with others. When coming to the main page of the video, the user will see 8 different sections, namely Animation, Music, Movie, Life, News, Dance, Digital, Games. Click on the different sections to go to the corresponding video section. After clicking the picture, you will come to a new interface, and the video will start playing. Below the video, there is a row of buttons for download, comment and Thumb up. Users can make different operations according to their own ideas.

## 2. Architecture

The Mainpage, Subpage, User and Server are modules of our project. They are splitted into their own packages.
The dotted arrows represent that the class has access to another class. Each package contains a class and their relationships 
are shown through the UML package diagram. On a larger scale the diagram shows the relationship between the Mainpage, 
Subpage, User and Server.

Use Case: Watch videos

Actor: User 

Description: User can watch video and comment it with or without sign in
 
Pre-Conditions: User can access the website via internet.
 
Post-Conditions: User successfully watched the video 
 
Main Flow & Alternative Flows (shown with #.# format): 

1. User click on some video 
2. The system checks the address to which the video points on the Server 
2.1. System found the address and open it for the user. 
2.2. System unable to find the address and return “NOT FOUND” page.
3. User successfully watch the video. 

## 5. Design Patterns
## 6. Design principles

### Single Responsibility Principle: 
public class List
    {
      
        private List<Video> Videos = null;
        public List<Video> Videos
        {
            get
            {
                if (Videos == null)
                {
                    Videos = new List<Video>();
                }

                return Videos;
            }

            set
            {
                if (value != null)
                {
                    Videos = value;
                }
            }
        }
}
List class only stores instances of list videos

### Interface Segregation Principle:

public interface response

{
     
     int status= -1;
     
     String Message = "";
}we have one interface for requests to the server and one for responses from the server.

# D6.Implementation_2

## Introduction
Our website which is called Netshell is a video community that allows young people to watch and share videos, pushing videos based on personal choices and video quality.This helps users to find the videos which contain right values and suit their tastes. It's a open community designed for young people, everyone can create an account.Users can upload videos and download videos,they can make comments and share their own ideas about the video; For the low quality videos, they can report them and the administrator can remove them from sites. 
So far we have implemented most of the functions, such as user login, uploading and downloading videos, but the comments and thumbs up have not been completed yet. We will continue to perform the task later

## Code quality
The webpage code is very complicated, we mainly use html and CSS. Since we didn’t spend a long time studying webpage creation and there are other courses, we didn’t spend much time improving the code. But we attach great importance to the layout of the homepage, there are a total of 8 sections, so there will be a lot of duplicate content.

## Lessons learned
In order to put out this basic application, we had to read some articles to learn more how to use JavaScript although we have learned it. We also had to learn the git commands for posting things to the GitHub. We also watched videos that were posted in the discord on how to use and code in JavaScript.
I have learned our team members need more communication and exchanges, and next we'll focus on coding and communicating.

# Netshell Project

Our website which is called Netshell is a video community that allows young people to watch and share videos, pushing videos based on personal choices and video quality. This helps users to find the videos which contain right values and suit their tastes. It's a open community designed for young people, everyone can create an account. Users can upload videos and download videos,they can make comments and share their own ideas about the video; For the low quality videos, they can report them and the administrator can remove them from sites.
